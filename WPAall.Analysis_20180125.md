## 1. Filter variants

I'm using the vcf output from pyRAD 

/srv/kenlab/alexjvr_p1795/WPA/Jan2018


First I'm filtering for maf of 5%

```
vcftools --vcf WPAallMerged.vcf --maf 0.05 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out WPAall.s1

After filtering, kept 69 out of 69 Individuals
After filtering, kept 125671 out of a possible 184264 Sites
Run Time = 1.00 seconds
```

Next filter all loci genotyped in less than 80% of the individuals

```
vcftools --vcf WPAall.s1.recode.vcf --max-missing 0.8 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out WPAall.s2

After filtering, kept 69 out of 69 Individuals
After filtering, kept 15618 out of a possible 125671 Sites
Run Time = 0.00 seconds
```

Finally reduce linkage by filtering for one SNP per locus (assuming loci are 400bp in length)

```
vcftools --vcf WPAall.s2.recode.vcf --thin 400 --recode --recode-INFO-all --out WPAall.s3

After filtering, kept 69 out of 69 Individuals
After filtering, kept 2049 out of a possible 125671 Sites
Run Time = 0.00 seconds
```

Final output: 

2049 loci genotyped for 69 individuals. 

Genotyping rate of 0.886066


## 2. statistics on output
  
  ### a. pyradOpt graphs
  
To select the optimum number of clusters I ran pyRAD for 85-95% clustering across 10 individuals (2 per species). 

I copied all the stats output files to my computer: /Users/alexjvr/2016RADAnalysis/WPA/Jan2018_pyRADOpt

I copied the final tables from each of these into excel, added the clustering threshold and loaded this into R.

Graphs: pyradOpt.plots_20170124.pdf (on my computer). 

According the the graphs, it looks like the optimal clustering threshold is between 90-93%. For over clustering (low threshold) we expect high heterozygosity and low numnbers of loci, and for over splitting (high threshold) we expect low heterozygosity and increased loci. 

But remember that I have a filter for min-depth 2. So I see a decrease in the number of loci found at 93%. To me it looks like the heterozygosity decreases more rapidly at ~90 clustering threshold. At 94% loci are split up so much that even within species they are not the same anymore. 

I could probably choose a lower threshold... 

 ### b. number of loci -> filtering -> final loci
 
 
| Filter |	number of sites |
|-------------------------------------------------------|------|
|variants called by pyRAD	|184264|
|remove loci with minor allele frequency <5%	|125671|
|remove loci genotyped in less than 80% of individuals	|15618|
|reduce to one SNP per locus|	2049|
  
  
 ### c. number of loci called per individual
 
 Number of consensus reads in the final dataset. 
 
 in R: 
 
 ```

 poplist <- read.table("poplist", header=T)

WPAall.stats$colour <- poplist$colour

WPAall.stats <- WPAall.stats[order(WPAall.stats$species),] ##order by species name

WPAall.stats$Indiv <- factor(WPAall.stats$Indiv, levels=WPAall.stats$Indiv) ##keep the order of all the individuals

p22 <- ggplot(WPAall.stats, aes(x=Indiv, y=reads_consens)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", colour=WPAall.stats$colour)  ##barplot

pdf("WPAall.consensusReads.perIndiv.pdf")

dev.off()
 ```
 
  
 ### d. missingness per locus and per individual (heatmap)
  
  I can plot the missingness using vcfR https://knausb.github.io/vcfR_documentation/omitting_data.html
  
  First I have to gzip the vcf file and then import it into R: 
  
```
library(vcfR) 
vcf <- read.vcfR("WPAall.s3.vcf.gz")

dp <- extract.gt(vcf, element = "DP", as.numeric=TRUE) ##Creates a dataframe of the genotypes

vcf  ##gives info about the file
```

vcfR doesn't see ./. as missing data if any depth information is available. i.e. it thinks there's no missing data. But I can get around this by assigning all missing genotypes (coded 0 in dp) to NA. 

```
dp2 <- dp ##so I don't have to keep recreating the dp file

dp2(dp2==0) <- NA ##and I double checked with the vcf file if the missing data was in the correct place. 

vcf
***** Object of Class vcfR *****
69 samples
2049 CHROMs
2,049 variants
Object size: 2 Mb
11.32 percent missing data
*****        *****         *****
``` 

Okay, that corresponds with the 89% genotyping rate that i got before. I can create a really nice heatmap using vcfR, but I first want to sort the data by species so that we can compare the genotyping between them: 

``` 
dp2 <- as.data.frame(dp2)

dp3 <- dp2[c("PHE079", "PHE088", "PHE089", "PHE090", "PHE091", "PHE092", "PHE116", "PHE135", "PHE136", "PHE137", "PHE138", "PHE080", "PHE081", "PHE082", "PHE083", "PHE084", "PHE085", "PHE086", "PHE087", "PHE100", "PHE112", "PHE126", "PHE127", "PHE133", "PHE134", "PHE093", "PHE109", "PHE094", "PHE095", "PHE108", "PHE101", "PHE102", "PHE103", "PHE104", "PHE111", "PHE105", "PHE106", "PHE107", "PHE113", "PHE113.control1", "PHE113.control2", "PHE113.control3", "PHE139", "PHE139", "PHE140", "PHE141", "PHE142", "PHE143", "PHE144", "PHE145", "PHE146", "PHE147", "PHE148", "PHE149", "PHE150", "PHE150a", "PHE150b", "PHE150c", "PHE151", "PHE152", "PHE153", "PHE154", "PHE155", "PHE156", "PHE157", "PHE158", "PHE159", "PHE160", "PHE161", "PHE162")]

dp3 <- as.matrix(dp3)

pdf("WPA.Missingness.plot.pdf")
heatmap.bp(dp3[1:1000,], rlabels = FALSE)
dev.off()
``` 


## 3. Analyses as run by Edinburgh zoo before: 
  
  ### 3.1. Population Structure

  #### a. PCA 
    
```
library(pcadapt)

path_to_WPA <- "WPAall.s3.recode.vcf"

WPA.vcf <- read.pcadapt(path_to_WPA, type="vcf")

File attributes:
  meta lines: 10
  header line: 11
  variant count: 2049
  column count: 78
Meta line 10 read in.
All meta lines processed.
gt matrix initialized.
Character matrix gt created.
  Character matrix gt rows: 2049
  Character matrix gt cols: 78
  skip: 0
  nrows: 2049
  row_num: 0
Processed variant: 2049
All variants processed
 2049 variants have been processed.
 14 variants have been discarded as they are not SNPs.
 
```
 
 How many principal components explain the data? 
 
 I had to rename tmp.pcadapt to WPAall.s3.recode.pcadapt in bash (in the folder)
 ```
 x <- pcadapt(WPA.vcf, K=20)
 
pdf(WPA.pcadapt.screeplot.pdf)
plot(x,option="screeplot")  ##PC for pop structure = on the steep curve
dev.off()
```

And plot the PCA with populations coloured

```
poplist <- read.table("poplist", head=T)
attach(poplist) <- poplist[order(indiv),] ##make sure that this is in the same order as in the vcf file (check vcf with bcftools query -l)
poplist$species <- as.character(poplist$species) #to keep the order this has to be factorised

pdf("WPAall.pca.pdf")
plot(x,option="scores",pop=poplist$species)
dev.off()
```
 
 
 Â #### b. fastStructure with all individuals
  
Convert vcf to fastStructure format using pgdSpider. 

copy onto server and run K1-10. These have to specified manually
```
/usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/local/ngseq/src/fastStructure-1.0_20160929/structure.py -K 1 --format=str --input=WPAall.s3.str --output=WPA_K1.1

```

Choose the model complexity (How many Ks)
```
/usr/bin/python2.7 /usr/local/ngseq/src/fastStructure-1.0_20160929/chooseK.py --input=/srv/kenlab/alexjvr_p1795/WPA/Jan2018/WPAall.Analyses/fastStr/WPA

Model complexity that maximizes marginal likelihood = 5
Model components used to explain structure in data = 5
```

And now I'll create the structure plots for K5-8


Copy the output files to the mac. 


Graphs can be found here: WPAall.structure.plots_20180125.xlsx


#### c. DAPC

** I'm not using this analysis... 

Since fastStructure is not available immediately, I'll replicate the Zoo's analysis with DAPC to look at population assignment: 

```
library(adegenet)

WPA.dapc <- read.structure("WPAall.s3.str")  ##original structure input from vcf2str in pgdspider. 2049 loci, 69 individuals. Col 2 = pop assignment. 

##estimate the number of clusters

grp.WPAall <- find.clusters(WPA.dapc, max.n.clust=40)

##kept 70 PCs (i.e. all of them)
##Chose K=7; this is where the graph flattens off, and it is the expected number of species. 


dapc1.WPA <- dapc(WPA.dapc, grp.WPAall$grp)
scatter(dapc1.WPA)
```
 
 ### 3.2. Hybridisation with Mountain peacock (query individuals)
  
 First I'll subset all the data to include only the query samples, Mountain, Malaysian, Grey, and Bronze. 
 
 ```
 vcftools --vcf WPAall.s3.recode.vcf --keep Malaysian.Mountain.Grey.Bronze.names --recode --recode-INFO-all --out WPAsubset
 ```
 Â 
  
  #### a. PCA with 
  
 
``` Â  Â 
path_to_WPAsubset <- "WPAsubset.recode.vcf"

WPAsubset.vcf <- read.pcadapt(path_to_WPAsubset, type="vcf")
 
```
 
 How many principal components explain the data? 
 
 I had to rename tmp.pcadapt to WPAall.s3.recode.pcadapt in bash (in the folder)
 ```
 x <- pcadapt(WPAsubset.vcf, K=20)
 
 Reading file WPAsubset.recode.pcadapt...
Number of SNPs: 2039
Number of individuals: 53
Number of SNPs with minor allele frequency lower than 0.05 ignored: 299

```

And plot the PCA with populations coloured

```

Model complexity that maximizes marginal likelihood = 3
